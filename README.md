## TicTac

### User Stories
`TODO://` In the **User Stories section below**, add an `x` in the `-[ ]` like this `- [x]` for any user story you complete. (üö´ Remove this paragraph after checking off completed user stories)

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (2pts) Create Process, It goes to the CPU directly if the Readyqueue is empty. If the current process's priority is less than the new process, the new process goes directly to CPU, and the old process goes back to the ReadyQueue
- [x] (5pts) ReadyQueue's queue is based on priority. I used Priority Queue. Similarly if Disk Read Request is called the currently running Process in the CPU goes to the disk and and sends the required string. The Process comes back to the CPU. If DiskJobCompleted is called the process from the disk goes back to ReadyQueue. 
- [x] (3pts) Print RAM, and update RAM.

#### BONUS
- [ ] (2pt) Print the linked list to find out which one is least used frame and most used frame in RAM.
